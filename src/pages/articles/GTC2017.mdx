This year’s GTC organized a healthcare track dedicated to applications at the nexus of artificial intelligence and healthtech. A number of workshops focused on applying machine learning algorithms using Nvidia hardware, Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), to predict the onset of early stage cancer detection, with many sessions analyzing other cancerous tumors in anatomical structures such as the lung, breast, and brain. Many sessions analyzed brain fMRI in particular as a means of advancing studies on various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).When you’re building a website for a company as ambitious as Planetaria, you need to make an impression. I wanted people to visit our website and see animations that looked more realistic than reality itself.

Below are some quick highlights from the sessions as well as few notes on Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) demonstrations and the implications of the dynamic user interface for medical research technical applications.

Researchers are able to take images from the various scanners used to see anatomical structures in the human body, enhance and augment the images, detect pathology , diagnose disease, and in some cases, even help with the other end of the spectrum, with treatment and prognosis as described in the picture above.
