    'As I have spoken at several conferences about the subject of Justice, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging at various events over the years, I thought I would share a resource link list of groups and other resources since I frequently am asked to for folks to pick my brain on how to get started in the tech industry as a woman in tech, particularly for those who want to become software engineers. I personally do not have the bandwidth to meet with everyone (that is impossible and I have had an overflowing amount of inbound messages that I am unable to respond to everything), so I hope this will be a good substitute to redirect folks to that may help get them started and guide them a little bit in the initial part of their professional journeys.',

## Find a Support System: Join womxn in tech groups  
1. <a href="https://github.com/maggiewhite/bayareawomenintech">Here</a> is a repo on GitHub for Bay Area women in tech. It does not have a complete list of groups, but a pretty comprehensive one a few years ago and many of the groups are still active. Look them up to see the most updated information on their website for their respective Telegrams, Discord and Slack channels and other social media networks.
2. Here is a repo of cryptocurrency/blockchain/web3 women groups that I have personally participated in over the years, or recommend joining. Others are referrals from others.
3. There are still a plethora of growing groups in other areas, from AI to metaverse, I've listed another awesome-list repository here.


## Create your own personal board of directors, start with getting a technical mentor 

1. Some tips for mentorship for mentors can be found in this great <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Myths-Magic-Mentoring-Facilitate/dp/0787956759/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2DEXNPY02WHH1&keywords=beyond+the+myths+and+magic+of+mentoring&qid=1674482053&sprefix=beyond+the+myth+and+magic%2Caps%2C206&sr=8-1">book</a> called, <i>Beyond the Myths and Magic of Mentoring: How to Facilitate an Effective Mentoring Process by Margo Murray.</i>
2. Don't limit your mentors to only womxn from your ethnic or racial community. I have had mentors that self-identify as progressive white allies and others from other communities of color who have been just as supportive as a mentor and sponsor in helping me advance in the next chapter of my career. I have had mentors in every industry I have worked in, from civic engagement, technology, and creative entertainment technology. 
3. Not all mentorship is structured (although I have joined some great structured mentorship programs with full schedules and those committed to seeing me succeed. A few were: Women in High Performance Computing (HPC), others that were so informal folks brought me under their wing came from my Women Who Code local chapter in Silicon Valley (they did not have mentorship programs at all or a ton of structure at the time). Other mentors I gained by being involved in meetup organizing, one from Stanford Venture Lab (VLAB), who today is a startup adviser of mine and friend.
4. I have created mentorship programs via the non-profit organization I founded, FASTER - Filipinx Americans in STEAM - Science Technology Engineering Arts and Mathematics, which focuses on college students, initially we started with UC Berkeley (my alma mater) and Stanford. Over the past 5 years, we have helped hundreds of students and many have landed full time careers in technical, design, product management, operations, and other business roles.
